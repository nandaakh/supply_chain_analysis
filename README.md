#### **Background**

Supply chain analysis is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data about a company's supply chain in order to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. This can involve a variety of data, such as product types, SKUs, prices, availability, number of products sold, revenue generated, customer demographics, stock levels, lead times, order quantities, shipping times, shipping carriers, shipping costs, supplier names, locations, lead times, production volumes, manufacturing lead time, manufacturing costs, inspection results, defect rates, transportation modes, routes, and costs.

#### **Purpose of the Project**

The purpose of the project data is to use it to perform supply chain analysis and identify opportunities for improvement. The data can be used to answer a variety of questions, such as:

1. What products are most popular?
2. What are the most profitable products?
3. What are our stock levels?
4. What are our lead times?
5. How much are we spending on shipping?
6. What are our supplier costs?
7. What are our manufacturing costs?
8. What are our defect rates?
9. How can we improve our transportation?

The answers to these questions can help us make better decisions about our supply chain, such as:

1. Which products should we focus on?
2. Where should we open new warehouses?
3. Which suppliers should we work with?
4. How can we improve our manufacturing process?
5. How can we reduce our shipping costs?
6. How can we improve our customer service?

#### **Dataset Information**

We got the dataset that we used [here](https://statso.io/supply-chain-analysis-case-study/), and this project was inspired by the data analysis project by Aman Kharwal. The dataset information is as follows:

- **Product Type:** The type of product, such as clothing, electronics, or food.
- **SKU:** The unique identifier for a product.
- **Price:** The price of the product.
- **Availability:** Whether the product is in stock or out of stock.
- **Number of products sold:** The number of products that have been sold in a given period of time.
- **Revenue generated:** The total amount of money that has been generated from the sale of products in a given period of time.
- **Customer demographics:** The demographic information about customers who have purchased products, such as age, gender, location, and income.
- **Stock levels:** The number of products that are currently in stock.
- **Lead times:** The amount of time it takes to receive a product from a supplier.
- **Order quantities:** The number of products that are typically ordered in a single order.
- **Shipping times:** The amount of time it takes to ship a product to a customer.
- **Shipping carriers:** The shipping carriers that are used to ship products to customers.
- **Shipping costs:** The costs associated with shipping products to customers.
- **Supplier name:** The name of the supplier who provides a product.
- **Location:** The location of the supplier.
- **Lead time:** The amount of time it takes for a supplier to produce a product.
- **Production volumes:** The number of products that a supplier can produce in a given period of time.
- **Manufacturing lead time:** The amount of time it takes for a supplier to manufacture a product.
- **Manufacturing costs:** The costs associated with manufacturing a product.
- **Inspection results:** The results of inspections that are performed on products before they are shipped to customers.
- **Defect rates:** The percentage of products that are defective.
- **Transportation modes:** The modes of transportation that are used to ship products to customers.
- **Routes:** The routes that are used to ship products to customers.
- **Costs:** The costs associated with transporting products to customers.

This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of a company's supply chain. By analyzing this data, businesses can identify opportunities to improve their efficiency and effectiveness, and ultimately, their bottom line.

#### **Role and Responsibility**

My role in this project is as a Data Analyst, who is responsible for carrying out the following tasks, including data interpretation, data transformation, data cleaning, and conducting descriptive analysis and visualization to get the insights needed.

**nb: Because I use the 'plotly' library for visualization and there is a possibility that the visualization may not appear when you open the notebook file, I hope you are willing to use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/), then copy the URL of the notebook file and paste it in the nbviewer view.
